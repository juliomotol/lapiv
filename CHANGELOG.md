        ```php
        Route::namespace('\App\Http\Controllers\Api')
            ->group(function () {
                Route::lapiv(function (){
                    Route::get('foo', 'FooGatewayController@index');
                    Route::get('foo/{foo}', 'FooGatewayController@show');
                })
            });
        ```
